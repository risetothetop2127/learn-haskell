# Examples

This project contains some examples to check your understanding.

* [src/FactFibMemo.hs](https://instinctive.github.io/learn-haskell/docs/examples/FactFibMemo.html): Some problems in recursion and an example of memoization. Click through the link to see a nicely-formatted version of the file's comments.

You can test your solutions to the problems by running:

    $ cd examples # this directory
    $ stack test

* Can you write the required code so that the examples work?
* Do you understand `(y fact') 3` ?
* Do you understand `((y (memo . fib')) 3` ?
